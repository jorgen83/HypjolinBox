# HypjolinBox
Hypjolin 3d printable box and panel design

The box can be printed as is on any 3d printer, without supports. The panel is sized to fit to it, with very little play. Be sure to use thread inserts in the 4 mounting holes (M3). 

This panel is made for 5mm LED fresnel lenses, not the original wimpy 3mm.
